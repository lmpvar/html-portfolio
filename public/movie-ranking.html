<h1>Laura's Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies (even though I don't actually like watching movies)</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Cold Comfort Farm</h3>
<p>This is a movie that never fails to make me laugh and is where 
    I learned there is no butter in hell.</p>
<h3>Star Wars series</h3>
<p>Yes, all of them. I am not sorry and I will not stop.</p>
<h3>Harry Potter 3-7 (2)</h3>
<p>But not the first two. Those are garbage.</p>
